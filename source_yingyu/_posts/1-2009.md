对动物智力的研究总是让我感到惊奇于人类是多么的聪明。考虑下卡尔·泽迈尔在《科学时代》描述的果蝇实验。被教的比一般果蝇更聪明的果蝇往往活的较短。这表明较暗的灯泡亮的更久，不那么亮是一种优势。

Is there an adaptive value to <u>9</u> intelligence? That’s the question behind this new research.

Research on animal intelligence also makes us wonder what experiments animals would <u>13</u> on humans if they had the chance.

对动物智力的研究也使我们想知道如果实验动物们有机会它们会对人类做什么。比如，每只猫和它的主人进行一场关于条件反射的小规模的研究。我们相信如果动物掌管了实验室，他们会测试我们来测定我们耐心，信仰，对位置的记忆的极限。他们将试图判定人类智力真正的意图是什么，而不仅仅是智力有多少。最重要的是，他们会希望去研究一个基本问题：人类到底了不了解他们生活的世界？迄今为止，结果还不明确。

<summary>
Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. “Not choice, but habit rules the unreflecting herd,” William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-changing 21st century, even the word “habit” carries a negative implication.
</summary>
<div class="text">
习惯是一个有趣的事情。我们无一时地使用它，设置我们的大脑处于自动模式并放松地进入熟悉过程带来的无意识舒适状态。“不是选择，而是习惯统治着不思考的人们，”威廉姆·卧尔兹·沃尔斯在19世纪说到。在不断变化的21世纪，甚至单词“habit”都有了负面含义。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
So it seems paradoxical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new habits, we create parallel paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在同样的背景下，谈论习惯和创造力创新力似乎是矛盾的。但是大脑研究人员发现当我们有意识的去开发习惯，我们可以创造出类似的路径，甚至是完全新的脑细胞，这些脑细胞使我们的思路跳跃到新的创新轨道上。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Rather than dismissing ourselves as unchangeable creatures of habit, we can instead direct our own change by consciously developing new habits. In fact, the more new things we try — the more we step outside our comfort zone — the more inherently creative we become, both in the workplace and in our personal lives.
</summary>
<div class="text">
不要将自己看作是一成不变的习惯生物，相反我们可以通过有意识地开发新习惯来主导我们自己的变化。实际上，我们尝试越多的事情——我们越多地走出我们的舒适区——我们越会在工作场所和私人生活中变得具有内在创造力。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
But don’t bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are worn into the brain, they’re there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately press into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.
</summary>
<div class="text">
但是不要费心去试图消灭光旧习惯；一旦那些过程的凹槽被磨损进大脑，它们就将呆在那儿。相反，我们有意按压进去的习惯创造了可以绕过那些就路径的类似的路径。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
“The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder,” says Dawna Markova, author of <i>The Open Mind</i>. “But we are taught instead to ‘decide,’ just as our president calls himself ‘the Decider.’ ” She adds, however, that “to decide is to kill off all possibilities but one. A good innovational thinker is always exploring the many other possibilities.”
</summary>
<div class="text">
“创新所需的第一件事是对好奇心的迷恋”《开放性思维》的作者多嗯呐·马科娃说到。“但是相反我们被教成去‘决定’，”正如我们的总统将他自己叫为‘决定者。’“但是她补充到，”做决定将杀死除了一种之外的所有可能性。一个好的创新的思考者总是在探索许多其它的可能性。“
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
All of us work through problems in ways of which we’re unaware, she says. Researchers in the late 1960s discovered that humans are born with the capacity to approach challenges in four primary ways: analytically, procedurally, relationally (or collaboratively) and innovatively. At the end of adolescence, however, the brain shuts down half of that capacity, preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed most valuable during the first decade or so of life.
</summary>
<div class="text">
她说，我们所有人都是通过无意识的方法解决问题。在20世纪60年代晚期，研究人员发现人类天生具有能力以4个主要方式处理挑战：分析方式，程序化方式，关联方式（或协作方式）和创新方式。但是，在青少年结束时大脑关闭了一半的能力，仅保存了那些在前十年左右生活中看起来最有价值的思维模式。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of thought. “This breaks the major rule in the American belief system — that anyone can do anything,” explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book <i>This Year I Will...</i> and Ms. Markova’s business partner. “That’s a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. Knowing what you’re good at and doing even more of it creates excellence.” This is where developing new habits comes in.
</summary>
<div class="text">
当前对标准化测试的强调聚焦于分析和过程，意味着我们几乎不会本能地去使用我们的创新协作思维模式。“着打破了美国信仰体系的主要规则——任何人可以做任何事，”2006年书籍《今年我要...》的作者和马科娃的商业合伙人M.J.瑞恩解释道。“那是我们长存的谎言，它助长了平庸。了解你擅长什么病更多的去从事它能创造卓越的才能。”这才是产生新习惯起作用的地方。

It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can boost his paternal (fatherly) wisdom — or at least confirm that he’s the kid’s dad. All he needs to do is shell out $30 for paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore — and another $120 to get the results.

More than 60,000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first become available without prescriptions last years, according to Doug Fogg, chief operating officer of Identigene, which makes the over-the-counter kits.

Among the most popular: paternity and kinship testing, which adopted children can use to find their biological relatives and families can use to track down kids put up for adoption. DNA testing is also the latest rage among passionate genealogists — and supports businesses that offer to search for a family’s geographic roots .

But some observers are skeptical. “There is a kind of false precision being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing,” says Troy Duster, a New York University sociologist. He notes that each individual has many ancestors — numbering in the hundreds just a few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father’s line or mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down only from mothers. This DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people also have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-grandparents.
</summary>
<div class="text">
但是一些观察家持怀疑态度。纽约大学社会学家特洛伊达斯特说，“那些声称正在做祖先测试的人们吹嘘了一种虚假的准确度。”他表示，每个个体都有许多个祖先——仅仅一个世纪以前就是数以百计。但是大多数祖先测试仅仅考虑一个单系血统，要么是在父系线中通过男性继承的Y染色体，要么是从母亲传下来的线粒体DNA。尽管这个DNA可以揭示关于一个或两个祖先的遗传信息，比如，仅仅三代以前人们也有6个其他的曾祖父母，或者四代以前有14个曾曾祖父母。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good as the reference collections to which a sample is compared. Databases used by some companies don’t rely on data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research projects. This means that a DNA database may have a lot of data from some regions and not others, so a person’s test results may differ depending on the company that processes the results. In addition, the computer programs a company uses to estimate relationships may be patented and not subject to peer review or outside evaluation.
</summary>
<div class="text">
批评家们也认为商业化的基因测试的好坏仅仅取决于样本用来比较的数据参考集。一些公司使用的数据库不依赖于系统地收集数据，而是混合来自不同研究项目的信息。这意味着DNA数据库可能有来自某些地区的很多数据而其他地方很少，所以一个人的测试结果可能会不同，这取决于处理结果的公司。另外，公司用来估算亲属关系的计算机程序可能是申请过专利的，所以不服从于同行评审或外部评估。

The relationship between formal education and economic growth in poor countries is widely misunderstood by economists and politicians alike. Progress in both areas is undoubtedly necessary for the social, political, and intellectual development of these and all other societies; however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong. We are fortunate that it is, because building new educational systems there and putting enough people through them to improve economic performance would require two or three generations. The findings of a research institution have consistently shown that workers in all countries can be trained on the job to achieve radically higher productivity and, as a result, radically higher standards of living.

Ironically, the first evidence for this idea appeared in the United States. Not long ago, with the country entering a recession and Japan at its pre-bubble peak, the U.S. workforce was derided as poorly educated and one of primary causes of the poor U.S. economic performance. Japan was, and remains, the global leader in automotive-assembly productivity. Yet the research revealed that the U.S. factories of Honda, Nissan, and Toyota achieved about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts — a result of the training that U.S. workers received on the job.

What is the real relationship between education and economic development? We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when governments don’t force it. After all, that’s how education got started. When our ancestors were hunters and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they didn’t have time to wonder much about anything besides finding food. Only when humanity began to get its food in a more productive way was there time for other things.
</summary>
<div class="test">
教育和经济发展之间真正的关系是什么？我们不得不猜想即使在政府不强制的情况下，持续的经济增长也可以推动教育的发展。毕竟，那正是教育如何开始的。10000年前当我们的祖先还是猎人和收集者时，他们没有时间去弄清楚除了寻找食物的任何事。只有当人类开始以一个更高效的方式获得食物时，才有时间考虑其它事情。
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
As education improved, humanity’s productivity potential increased as well. When the competitive environment pushed our ancestors to achieve that potential, they could in turn afford more education. This increasingly high level of education is probably a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the complex political systems required by advanced economic performance. Thus poor countries might not be able to escape their poverty traps without political changes that may be possible only with broader formal education. A lack of formal education, however, doesn’t constrain the ability of the developing world’s workforce to substantially improve productivity for the foreseeable future. On the contrary, constraints on improving productivity explain why education isn’t developing more quickly there than it is.
</summary>
<div class="test">
随着教育的改善，人类的生产潜力也提高了。当竞争环境推动我们的祖先实现这种潜力时，他们又反过来能承受更多的教育。对于优秀的经济表现需要的复杂的政治体系，这个越来越高水平的教育很可能只是一个必要不充分的条件。因此贫穷国家在没有政治改变时，可能没能力逃脱他们的贫穷陷阱，而政治改变可能只有通过广泛的正规教育才能实现。但是，正规教育的缺失不会限制发展世界劳动力在可预见的未来显著地提高生产力的能力。相反，对提高生产力的限制解释了为什么教育不能发展的更快。

The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the new world are the ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was “so much importance attached to intellectual pursuits.” According to many books and articles, New England’s leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life.
</summary>
<div class="text">
在新世界历史中被研究的最彻底的知识分子是17世纪新英格兰的部长和政治领袖们。根据标准的美国哲学史，在殖民的美洲，没有其他地方是“如此的重视对知识的追求。”根据许多书籍和文章，新英格兰的领导们确立了在美国知识分子生活中逐渐发展的、占据主导的清教徒传统的基本主题和关注点。

<summary>
To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start with the Puritans’ theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church-important subjects that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture, adjusting to New World circumstances. The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.
</summary>
<div class="text">
采取这种方法来研究新英格兰人一般意味着以清教徒的神学革新和他们独特的关于教会的理念为开头——这些是我们不能忽略的对象。但是为了能和对南部知识分子生活保持一致，我们可以将原始清教徒视为欧洲文化的携带者，他们正在适应新的世界环境。在追求对文明礼貌和技艺精湛理想的广泛认识时，新英格兰殖民地是很多重要事件的场景。

The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education and influence in England. Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to Massachusetts churches in the decade after 1629, there were political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. These men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness.
</summary>
<div class="text">
马塞诸塞州酒海湾的早期定居者包含了英格兰受过良好教育和有影响力的人物。除了在1629年后的10年来到马塞诸塞教堂的90个左右的博学的牧师，还有政治领袖，如约翰·温斯洛破，他是一名受过教育的绅士、律师并且在旅行到波士顿前担任皇家官员。这些人广泛地协作和发表文章到新旧世界的观众，并带给新英格兰一个认真对待知识的氛围。

We should not forget, however, that most New Englanders were less well educated. While few crafts men or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left literary compositions to be analyzed, it is obvious that their views were less fully intellectualized. their thinking often had a traditional superstitious quality. A tailor named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for leaving England that is filled with signs. Sexual confusion, economic frustrations, and religious hope-all came together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, told his father that the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the magical words: “Come out from among them, touch no unclean thing, and I will be your God and you shall be my people.” One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons explaining the Bible that he heard in Puritan churches.
</summary>
<div class="text">
但是，我们不应该忘记，大多数新英格兰人没怎么受过好的教育。尽管有很少的工匠和农民，更不用说从属和仆从，留下文学作品用来分析，很明显他们的观点不够理智。他们的思考通常带有传统迷信的特质。一个名叫的约翰·大恩的裁缝在17世纪30年代末移民国外，留下了对离开英格兰原因的叙述，这个叙述充满了神迹。性别困惑、经济挫折和宗教希望——所有的都在他打开圣经这一决定性的时刻汇集到一起，他告诉他的父亲，他看见的第一行将决定他的命运，进而读到这些有魔力的文字：“从他们之中出来，不要触摸不洁的事物，我将是你的上帝，你将是我的人民。”人们想知道大恩如怎么考虑他在清教徒教会中听到的解释圣经的精心布道的。
</div>

Meanwhile, many settlers had slighter religious commitments than Dane’s, as one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had not come to the New World for religion. “Our main end was to catch fish.”
</summary>

同时，许多定居者比大恩有着更微弱的宗教承诺，正如一个牧师在面对沿着海滨的人所了解到的，这个人嘲笑到，他们不是为了宗教来到新世界，“我们的主要目的是为了抓鱼。”

There is a marked difference between the education which every one gets from living with others, and the deliberate educating of the young. In the former case the education is incidental; it is natural and important, but it is not the express reason of the association. <u class="nospace">(46)It may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution is its effect in enlarging and improving experience, but this effect is not a part of its original motive.</u> Religious associations began, for example, in the desire to secure the favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil influences; family life in the desire to gratify appetites and secure family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most part, because of enslavement to others, etc. <u class="nospace">(47) Only gradually was the by-product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was this effect considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the institution.</u> Even today, in our industrial life, apart from certain values of industriousness and thrift, the intellectual and emotional reaction of the forms of human association under which the world's work is carried on receives little attention as compared with physical output.

<div class="test">
从和他人一起生活获得的教育和对年轻人的刻意教育有明显的不同。在前者的情况中教育是附带的；虽然这种教育是自然且重要的，但是它并不是这种人际交往的特定原因。<u class="nospace">(46)可以说，对任何社会机构的衡量就是它在加强和改善人生经验中的作用，但是这种作用不是它原始动机的一部分。</u>例如，宗教团体的建立，是渴望获得神明的支持和避开邪恶的影响；家庭生活是渴望满足欲望和获得家庭的永存；系统的劳动大多数是因为其他人的奴役，等等。 <u class="nospace">(47)这种机构的副产品才逐渐被注意到，而这种作用也才被逐渐看作这种机构行为的指导性因素。</u>甚至是工业化生活的今天，除了勤奋和节俭等某些价值观，对人类交际形式产生的智力的和情绪的反应相比于物质上的产出很少被注意到，而这个世界是在这些反应下运行的。

But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an immediate human fact, gains in importance. <u class="nospace">(48) While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults.</u> The need of training is too evident and the pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and habits is too urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. <u class="nospace">(49)Since our chief business with them is to enable them to share in a common life we cannot help considering whether or not we are forming the powers which will secure this ability.</u> If humanity has made some headway in realizing that the ultimate value of every institution is its distinctively human effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned largely through dealings with the young.
